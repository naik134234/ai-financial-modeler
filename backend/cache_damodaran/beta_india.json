":"Simple average across firms of each firm's  beta, taken as a weighted average of 2-year and 5-year weekly return regression betas, with 2-year betas weighted 2\/3rds. If the company has only a 2-year beta, it is used.","Unnamed: 2":"I average the 2-year and 5-year betas, to remove some noise at the company level, and then take the simple average to remove even more. I don't use weighted averages, since that will make each sector's beta converge on its largest company or companies."},{"End Game":"D\/E Ratio","To estimate pure play betas by business, to use in estimating a bottom up beta for a project or a company.
